Usage
======

1. Add feature layers that have a relationship. Note: the layers must be type: 'feature', this widget will not display related records in dynamic layers. Also, mode should be set to ON_DEMAND or SNAPSHOT. SELECTION will not work currently.
2. Ensure a proxy is configured and working
2. Set the widget config to include a layerInfos
3. Set the widget to be 'open' or visible by default ( this is important for the tab container to render correctly )
3. Click on a feature layer to see related records.
4. Bonus: Set up columnInfos to format relationship table.

Options:
========

Key        |      Type      | Default |  Description
---|-----|-------|----
layerInfos | boolean | `null` | set layerControlLayerInfos to true, a layerInfos object is required
formatters | {object} | `{}` |  key, value pairs of column formatter functions. Key is either a field name or esri field type.
columnInfos | {object} | `{}` | An object describing each relationship
tabPosition | string |  `'left-h'` | dijit tabContainer.tabPosition property: `'top'`, `'left-h'`, Not working due to layout issues: `'bottom'`, `'right-h'` 
tabContainerId | string | `null` | An optional id of a widget that is a tabContainer or contains a tabContainer property. If specified, this widgets tables will be added to an existing tabContainer like the one developed by tmcgee [here](https://github.com/tmcgee/cmv-widgets/blob/master/widgets/AttributesTable/README.md) instead of creating a new one.
